During an interglacial interval, there's a pronounced tendency for the retreat of enormous glaciers in the southernmost regions. This geological phenomenon, well-studied by oceanographers using isotopic analysis and radiometric dating, is marked by distinct changes in isotope proportions within foraminifera shells. These variations differ significantly from the isotopic composition of calcite carbonate formed during glaciation. As the glaciers advance and retreat, they leave behind heterogenous drift and moraines as signs of their colossal accumulation and retreat. The rolling elevation of present-day icy landforms and the continuous accumulation of debris can deceive observers with surplus icebergs that often calve and drift outward into the polar and temperate oceans.

The variable nature of iceberg calving sometimes exceeds expectations, causing a match between inward and outward currents, creating an interlock of icebergs. Firn flakes recrystallize into hexagonal granular snowfall as a result of compaction and refreezing, ultimately lessening the rounded crystal structure and resembling a mineral. As icebergs break away, they may tear into the hardened ooze on the ocean floor, leading to turbulent cascades that are nothing short of spectacular. This process is an essential adjustment in the delicate balance of the Earth's hydrologic cycle, with the potential to cause deluges and upward movements in sea levels, making it a fascinating and awesome aspect of our planet's geography.
