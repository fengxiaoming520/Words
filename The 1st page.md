After the volcanic eruption, the molten lava instantly solidified into thick, porous basalt rock. Over time, the rock underwent consolidation and cementation, reducing its porosity and permeability. Water, containing minute amounts of dissolved chemicals, percolated through the rock's crevices and cavities, aided by the force of gravity. The water clung firmly to the rock particles, forming a thin film and creating tension within the porous structure. As the water drained downslope, it spread out fanwise, infiltrating the surrounding area. The precipitation soaked into the ground, slowly moving through the porous basalt. The incredible process of water infiltration and percolation remains largely out of sight, hidden within the depths of the rock.
